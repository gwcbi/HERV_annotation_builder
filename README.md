# HERV Annotation Builder

##### A toolkit for identifying HERV proviruses using repeat annotations

For each family, we download RepeatMasker annotations for the internal and LTR regions. In
order to identify "proviruses", we merge internal regions with flanking LTR regions in the
same direction. The proviruses we identify are visually checked using IGV and are named
according to the cytogenic band where it is found.
